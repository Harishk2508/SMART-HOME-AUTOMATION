# Smart Home Automation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Home Automation project repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation for building a home automation system using the ESP8266 microcontroller, a relay module, and a webpage for control and monitoring. With this system, you can remotely control various appliances and devices in your home via the internet.

## Features

- Control appliances remotely using a web interface.
- Monitor and manage connected devices from anywhere with internet access.
- Expandable and customizable to suit your specific needs.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
- Relay Module
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply
- Appliances to Control

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 Board Support Package
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for Webpage
- MQTT Broker (optional for additional functionality)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the ESP8266, relay module, and appliances as per the provided instructions.

2. **Development Environment:** Install Arduino IDE and the ESP8266 board support package. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.

3. **Write Arduino Sketch:** Create the Arduino sketch to control the ESP8266 and relay module. Implement Wi-Fi connectivity and web server functionality.

4. **Create Web Interface:** Design and develop a web interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to control the appliances remotely.

5. **Upload Sketch to ESP8266:** Connect the ESP8266 to your computer via USB and upload the Arduino sketch using the Arduino IDE.

6. **Test the System:** Power up the ESP8266 and relay module. Access the web interface from a browser and test the functionality.

## Additional Notes

- Security: Consider implementing authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
- MQTT Integration: Integrate MQTT protocol for device-to-device communication and additional automation features.
- Sensor Integration: Add sensors to monitor environmental conditions and automate tasks based on sensor data.
